<p>
Belle IT has an established Enterprise Risk Management Program that incorporates Business Continuity Plans (BCPs) for all our critical activities, risk assessments, and crisis-management protocols. We activated this structure since the initial outbreak in China, with teams meeting at the country, function, and enterprise levels. Our executive staff are meeting regularly to monitor activities.
</p>
<br></br>

<h5 className="h-bold">Belle IT's Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Program</h5>
<p>
The ERM program provides a framework for identifying material risks. The program supports the businesses and functions in the documentation of the risk, how the risks are managed, and the update/creation of business continuity plans (BCPs) where appropriate. Oversight is provided by the Executive Risk Committee, which comprises CEO staff.

The ERM program has identified material risks, that include supply-chain disruption, loss of strategic suppliers, logistics disruptions, and site closures. BCPs exist to mitigate and manage these risks and we regularly assess and update them. We've successfully activated these BCPs—proactively in many cases—for surety of supply purposes and have been successful in ensuring we can continue to support our customers during the evolving situation with COVID-19.
